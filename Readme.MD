VKGL
====

OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile implementation over Vulkan.

This project is in WIP state. It is not functional yet and the development is planned
to progress at a slow (but steady) pace due to time constraints. 

Linux support is not planned at this stage, though any OS-specific tools are going
to be abstracted away to pave way for contributions in the future.


Current project goal: being able to launch & enjoy ID Software's Doom 3 game in
the wrapped environment.

Next: Khronos CTS conformance, support for newer core GL versions.
